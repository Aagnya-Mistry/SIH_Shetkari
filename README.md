# Shetkari - Crop Disease Detection and Prediction App  

**Shetkari** is an innovative app developed to empower farmers by leveraging AI and machine learning for early detection and prediction of crop diseases. This repository contains the source code, machine learning models, and documentation of the app, which was developed as part of the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** at the national level.  

## Features  
- **Disease Detection**: Farmers can upload images of diseased crops, and the app predicts the type of disease with high accuracy.  
- **Prediction Models**: Advanced ML models trained on agricultural datasets for early disease prediction.  
- **Preventive Measures**: Provides actionable recommendations to prevent and mitigate crop diseases.  
- **Audio Input Feature**: Farmers can describe crop conditions via audio, and the app suggests relevant information and solutions.  

## Development Team  
This project was created by a dedicated team of developers:  
- **App Development Lead**: Aagnya Mistry 
- **Team Members**: Chaahat Singh (Team Leader), Aayush Chaudhari, Chhavi Rathod, Kabir Mathur, and Daksh Goyal  
- **Mentors**: Hardik Gupta (ML Support) and Dr. Kriti Srivastava (Agricultural Insights)  
- **Guidance**: Shivam Nagoari (Flutter and Firebase)  

## Project Highlights  
- Reached the **grand finale** of SIH in our second year of college.  
- Integrated **Flutter** for app development and **TensorFlow/Keras** for machine learning models.  
- Focused on a user-friendly interface tailored for Indian farmers.   

Feel free to explore or contribute to this project to create solutions that help farmers around the world. ðŸŒ¾
